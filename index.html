      <p>
        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
        simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its ,interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
        in many areas on most platforms.</p>

      <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all
        major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org</a> , and may
        be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python
        modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>

      <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other
        languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

        <p>
          Python's name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum
          enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;
          for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs instead of the
          traditional foo and bar. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python
          routines.

    <section class="main-section" id="History">
      <header>History</header>
      <p>
        Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
        Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception
        handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum
        shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his
        "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python
        community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. He now
        shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council. In January 2019, active Python core
        developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member
        "Steering Council" to lead the project. Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020
        Steering council.</p>

      <p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage
        collector and support for Unicode.</p>

      <p>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely
        backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series.
        Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2
        code to Python 3.</p>

      <p>Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
        of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No more security patches or other improvements
        will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.

    <section class="main-section" id="Syntax_and_semantics">
      <header>Syntax and semantics</header>
      <p>
        Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses
        English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly
        brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and
        special cases than C or Pascal.</p>

      <h5 id="Indentation">Indentation</h5>
      <p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in
        indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.
        Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure. This feature is
        sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't
        have any semantic meaning.</p>

      <h5 id="Statements">Statements and control flow</h5>
      <p>Python's statements include (among others):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign).</li>
        <li>The <code>if</code> statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with <code>else</code>
          and <code>elif</code> (a contraction of else-if).</li>
        <li>The <code>for</code> statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local
          variable for use by the attached block.</li>
        <li>The <code>while</code> statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
        <li>The <code>try</code> statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and
          handled by <code>except</code> clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a <code>finally</code> block
          will always be run regardless of how the block exits.</li>
        <li>The <code>raise</code> statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.</li>
        <li>The <code>class</code> statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a
          class, for use in object-oriented programming.</li>
        <li>The <code>def</code> statement, which defines a function or method.</li>
        <li>The <code>with</code> statement, from Python 2.5 released in September 2006, which encloses a code block
          within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock
          afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
          (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.</li>
        <li>The <code>break</code> statement, exits from the loop.</li>
        <li>The <code>continue</code> statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.</li>
        <li>The <code>del</code> statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is
          deleted and trying to use that variable cause an error. Deleted variable can be reassigned to later as normal.
        </li>
        <li>The <code>pass</code> statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code
          block.</li>
        <li>The <code>assert</code> statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.</li>
        <li>The <code>yield</code> statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5,
          <code>yield</code> is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.
        </li>
        <li>The <code>return</code> statement, used to return a value from a function.</li>
        <li>The <code>import</code> statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used
          in the current program.</li>
        <li>The <code>print</code> statement was changed to the <code>print()</code> function in Python 3.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The assignment statement ('=') operates by binding a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated
        object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a
        variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to any object. Since a name is a generic reference
        holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time, a name will be bound
        to some object, which will have a type. This association is referred to as dynamic typing.</p>

      <p>Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van
        Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending
        Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of
        the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from
        Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.</p>

      <h5 id="Expressions">Expressions</h5>
      <p>Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two
          types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) <code>//</code> and floating
          point<code>/</code>division. Python also added the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.</li>
        <li>From Python 3.5, the new <code>@</code> infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by
          libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
        <li>From Python 3.8, the syntax <code>:=</code>, called the 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns values
          to variables as part of a larger expression.</li>
        <li>In Python, <code>==</code> compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by
          reference. (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the <code>equals()</code> method.)
          Python's <code>is</code> operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In
          Python, comparisons may be chained, for example <code>a &lt;= b &lt;= c.</code></li>
        <li>Python uses the words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> for its boolean operators rather
          than the symbolic <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> used in Java and C.</li>
      </ul>

    Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many
    tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It
    includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom
    numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>

  <p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface
    (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal
    documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a
    few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.</p>

  <p>As of November 2019, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software,
    contains over 200,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
  </p>

    Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a readâ€“evalâ€“print loop (REPL), permitting them to function
    as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.The
    most used python developing software or python IDE is PyCharm by JetBrains. A lightweight code editor can be Visual
    Studio Code by Microsoft.</p>

  <p>Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state
    retention and syntax highlighting.</p>

  <p>As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath
    (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting
    environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.

    Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE
    Programming Community Index where, as of February 2020, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C).
    It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007, 2010, and 2018.</p>

  <p>An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages,
    such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and
    determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".</p>

  <p>Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram,
    Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit is written entirely in
    Python.</p>

  <p>Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With
    Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like
    Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and
    maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based
    applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program
    communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.</p>

  <p>Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with
    specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a
    mathematical software with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of
    mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has python
    bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.</p>

  <p>Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite
    element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max,
    Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D
    imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and
    capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri
    promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and
    has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being
    Java and Go.</p>

  <p>Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of
    libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn. As a scripting language with modular architecture,
    simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.</p>

  <p>Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4
    (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, OpenBSD (as a package) and macOS and can be used from the
    command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity
    installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package
    management system, Portage.</p>

  <p>Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.</p>

  <p>Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python. The
    Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.</p>

  <p>LibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core
    feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.
